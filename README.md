# Parsing Multiple Xml files in a directory

This script parses all xml files in a directory and counts
the length of the abstracts and the bodytext of the articles, 
as well as the number of self mentions (i.e. 1st sg and pl personal pronouns). 
Then it appends the filename, the lengths of the abstracts and the body of the articles, 
and the count of self mentions to a csv file.
